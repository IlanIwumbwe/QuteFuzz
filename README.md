## Running the fuzzer

**Install python dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs all the helper functions we use for differential testing as well as all other dependencies required to run the circuits such as qiskit, pytket and cirq libraries.

**Generate and run circuits**
```sh
python run.py
```

This generates and runs a Pytket circuit by default

- To see all available flags, use `python run.py -h`.
- You can run the generator on its own by compiling using `make`. Generate n circuits using:
    ```sh
    ./gen -n {n}
    ```
- Full usage: `./gen -n {programs to generate} [-q/-p/-c]`
- If you want to monitor the generation steps more closely, you can compile with `DEV` flag by running `make DEV=1`

All quantum circuits, logs and results will be shown in a `quantum_circuits` folder in the repo directory

## A note on constants chosen

The constants were chosen with a preference towards generation of smaller individual circuits. We reasoned that if we can find bugs in smaller circuits, then this is still great. We often had to reduce the test cases before filing bug reports so this process was made easier too. Moreover, smaller circuits run much faster, and are quicker to generate, which reduces the time of our testing loop. We tried to focus on making the generator capable of generating expressive circuits such that if we generated a large volume of circuits, there would be some that could potentially cause problems for the compiler.   

Nonetheless, we believe there is still some exploration that can be done.
